# Run Waydroid on X11(Xorg) using Weston Compositor

This repository provides a simple setup for running **Waydroid** (Android container) on systems using **X11 (Xorg)** by leveraging **Weston** as a Wayland compositor wrapper.  

### Why is this useful?

- This repo is designed for **X11 users** who want to run Waydroid without switching their entire desktop environment to Wayland.  
- Easy install/uninstall scripts are included.
